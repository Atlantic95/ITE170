				Hello, it's me<br>
                I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
                To go over everything<br>
                They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
                But I ain't done much healing<br><br>
                Hello, can you hear me<br>
                I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
                When we were younger and free<br>
                I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>
                There's such a difference between us<br>
                And a million miles<br><br>
                Hello from the other side<br>
                I must have called a thousand times<br>
                To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
                But when I call you never seem to be home<br><br>
                Hello from the outside<br>
                At least I can say that I've tried<br>
                To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
                But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.
